# Complete-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Java-based-application-to-deploy-on-Kubernetes-cluster-using-Jenkins
Here's a brief explanation of the CI/CD pipeline that I have implemented :

Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform:

The pipeline starts with infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. This automates the setup of the required resources on AWS, such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters.
Configuring Jenkins with Ansible:

Ansible is used to configure Jenkins, including the master and build nodes. This ensures that Jenkins is set up consistently and can scale as needed.
Jenkins Pipeline Setup:

Within Jenkins, a pipeline job is created to automate the entire CI/CD process.
Jenkinsfiles are used to define and script the pipeline stages, including building, testing, code analysis, publishing artifacts, and deployment.
Multi-Branch Pipeline:

A multi-branch pipeline is set up, allowing different branches of your code repository to have their own CI/CD pipelines. This enables parallel development and testing.
GitHub Webhooks Integration:

GitHub webhooks are configured to trigger CI/CD processes automatically whenever code changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures continuous integration.
Code Quality Assessment with SonarQube:

SonarQube and Sonar Scanner are integrated into the pipeline to assess code quality. It checks for code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities.
Artifactory for Artifact Storage:

JFrog Artifactory is used to store Docker images and other artifacts produced during the CI/CD process. This ensures artifact management and version control.
Containerization with Docker:

Docker is utilized to containerize your applications. Dockerfiles are created to define how your applications should run in containers.
Kubernetes Deployment with Helm:

Terraform provisions a Kubernetes cluster, and Helm is used to manage Kubernetes deployments. Helm charts define the deployment configurations for your applications.
Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:

Helm charts are used to set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster and applications. This provides real-time insights into performance and reliability.

CI/CD pipeline automates the entire software development and deployment process. It begins with infrastructure provisioning, configures Jenkins and sets up a multi-branch pipeline. Code quality is assessed with SonarQube, and artifacts are stored in Artifactory. Docker containers are created, and Kubernetes handles deployment. Finally, Prometheus and Grafana offer continuous monitoring. This end-to-end automation ensures efficient and reliable software development and delivery.
